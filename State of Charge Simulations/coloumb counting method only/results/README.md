## SOC vs Time graph
As time increases, we can see SOC with error getting drifted away from true SOC, due to the erros mentioned above. and it increases casue COLOUMB counting means integrating current. SO current with errors means the errors also gets integrated and hence it grows as time grows since we are integrating with respect to time.
